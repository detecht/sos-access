Commercial Support
==================

sos-access is developed by Palmlund Wahlgren Innovative Technology AB. If you
need help integration this library we are available for consultation services.


We also run https://alarmer.io , an general integration service that gives you
a simple HTTP REST API instead of needing to integrate directly with alarm
operators.
